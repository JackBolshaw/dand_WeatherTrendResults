## Project Title
Exploring Weather Trends

## Description
In this project I was tasked with exploring the global average temperature change compared to the average temperature change in the closest city I call home, Birmingham UK. The data starts in the mid 18th century and runs until 2013.

This short project is part of my Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree.

## Conclusions

After the last mini ice age that ended in the 17th century both the global temperature and the temperature of my home city, Birmingham UK, have been maintained a similar difference.

Both the average temperature of Birmingham and the average global temperatures began to increase and has become more worrying toward the end of the 20th century and into the 21st century.

The Pearson Correlation Coefficient between Birmingham’s average temperature and the global average temperature is 0.875 which shows a strong relationship. I also imagine that the relationship between Birmingham’s temperature and the global temperature is linear.

The Pearson Correlation Coefficient between both local and global temperatures and the year is 0.762 which also shows a strong positive relationship. Meaning as the year increases, so does the temperature but this is probably not a linear relationship.

If I were to pursue this further, I would like to use an extended data set leading up to the present day. I would also like to investigate the relationship between global temperature with global population and Birmingham’s temperature and Birmingham’s population.
